#Front Test

You must write a single page apps using:
- Vuejs
- Vuex
- Vue-router

This app should allow to :
- List all user
- Add a new user

The page should not refresh between calls, there must be validation (using a random library or a custom validation), and new elements should be displayed inside the list.

You can use our skeleton, it use webpack for dependency management. Feel free to watch the config file, some aliases has been created.
You can aswell use another method.

## How to install

- go to src/front
- Run npm
Now webpack is installed.
